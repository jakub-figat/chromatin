Great! Let's think through the sequence module step by step.

## Sequence Model - What it needs

### Core fields:
- `name` - human-readable name for the sequence
- `sequence_data` - the actual sequence string (DNA/RNA/protein)
- `type` - enum: DNA, RNA, or PROTEIN
- `description` - optional text description
- `user_id` - foreign key to User (who owns it)
- `project_id` - foreign key to Project (optional, for organization)

### Computed/cached properties (decide if stored or calculated on-demand):
- `length` - len(sequence_data), probably calculated
- `gc_content` - for DNA only, maybe calculated
- `molecular_weight` - for proteins, maybe calculated

### Relationships:
- `user` - belongs to User
- `project` - optionally belongs to Project (with `lazy="raise"`)

## Project Model - Needed first

Before sequences, you need a simple Project model:
- `name` - project name
- `description` - optional
- `user_id` - foreign key to User
- `is_public` - boolean (private vs public projects)

**Relationships:**
- `user` - belongs to User
- `sequences` - has many Sequences (with `lazy="raise"`)

## Implementation order:

### Step 1: Project module (simpler, needed for sequences)
**Models:**
- `Project` model with basic fields

**Service functions:**
- `create_project(db, user_id, project_in)` - create project for user
- `get_project(db, project_id, user_id)` - get with ownership check
- `list_user_projects(db, user_id)` - list user's projects
- `update_project(db, project_id, user_id, project_in)` - update if owner
- `delete_project(db, project_id, user_id)` - delete if owner

**Routes:**
- `POST /api/projects` - create project (requires auth)
- `GET /api/projects` - list current user's projects
- `GET /api/projects/{id}` - get project details
- `PUT /api/projects/{id}` - update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` - delete project

### Step 2: Sequence module (core feature)

**Models:**
- `Sequence` model with fields above
- `SequenceType` enum (DNA, RNA, PROTEIN)

**Service functions:**
- `create_sequence(db, user_id, sequence_in)` - validate and create
- `get_sequence(db, sequence_id, user_id)` - get with permission check
- `list_sequences(db, user_id, project_id, filters)` - list with pagination
- `update_sequence(db, sequence_id, user_id, sequence_in)` - update metadata
- `delete_sequence(db, sequence_id, user_id)` - delete
- `validate_sequence(sequence_data, type)` - check valid characters
- `calculate_properties(sequence)` - GC content, length, etc.

**Parsers (separate module):**
- `parse_fasta(file_content)` - parse FASTA format, return list of sequences
- `validate_fasta(file_content)` - check if valid FASTA
- `sequences_to_fasta(sequences)` - export sequences to FASTA format

**Routes:**
- `POST /api/sequences` - create single sequence (JSON)
- `POST /api/sequences/upload` - upload FASTA file, create multiple
- `GET /api/sequences` - list sequences (with filters: project, type, search)
- `GET /api/sequences/{id}` - get sequence details
- `GET /api/sequences/{id}/properties` - get calculated properties
- `PUT /api/sequences/{id}` - update sequence metadata
- `DELETE /api/sequences/{id}` - delete sequence
- `GET /api/sequences/{id}/download` - download as FASTA
- `GET /api/sequences/export` - export multiple as FASTA (by project or IDs)

### Step 3: Sequence operations (basic analysis)

**Service functions:**
- `reverse_complement(sequence_data)` - for DNA
- `transcribe(sequence_data)` - DNA → RNA
- `translate(sequence_data, frame)` - DNA/RNA → protein
- `calculate_gc_content(sequence_data)` - for DNA
- `calculate_molecular_weight(sequence_data, type)` - for protein

**Routes:**
- `POST /api/sequences/{id}/reverse-complement` - get reverse complement
- `POST /api/sequences/{id}/transcribe` - transcribe DNA to RNA
- `POST /api/sequences/{id}/translate` - translate to protein
- These can return the result directly or create a new sequence

## Key design decisions to make:

1. **Ownership model**:
   - Can sequences be shared?
   - Public vs private sequences?
   - Start simple: user owns sequences, can only see their own

2. **Validation strictness**:
   - Reject sequences with invalid characters immediately?
   - Or allow and warn?
   - I'd say reject - better UX

3. **FASTA parsing**:
   - Multi-sequence FASTA should create multiple Sequence records
   - Each with its own name from the FASTA header
   - Batch insert for performance

4. **Properties calculation**:
   - Calculate on-demand vs store in DB?
   - For simple ones (length, GC%), calculate on-demand
   - For expensive ones (later, like structure), store

5. **Project relationship**:
   - Should sequences REQUIRE a project?
   - Or allow "loose" sequences?
   - I'd say optional - start loose, can add to project later

## Testing strategy:

**Unit tests (services):**
- Test validation logic
- Test FASTA parsing (valid, invalid, multi-sequence)
- Test sequence operations (reverse_complement, etc.)
- Test property calculations
- Test ownership checks

**Integration tests (routes):**
- Test CRUD operations with auth
- Test file upload
- Test filtering and pagination
- Test permission enforcement (can't access other user's sequences)

## What would you implement first?

I'd suggest this order:
1. **Project model + basic CRUD** (1-2 hours) - simple, gets relationships working
2. **Sequence model** (30 min) - just the model
3. **FASTA parser** (1 hour) - core functionality, test thoroughly
4. **Sequence CRUD routes** (2 hours) - create, read, update, delete
5. **Sequence operations** (1-2 hours) - reverse complement, translate, etc.
6. **Tests** (ongoing) - write as you go

Sound reasonable? Want to start with Project or jump straight to Sequence?
